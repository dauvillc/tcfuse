## Project overview

This project develops a machine learning framework for **tropical cyclone (TC) analysis and forecasting** by fusing heterogeneous observation sources. The central scientific idea is that each observation source — regardless of its physical nature — can be represented as a set of measurements associated with explicit spatio-temporal coordinates. This coordinate-aware multi-source representation is the backbone of the entire framework.

**Target tasks (in order of priority):**
1. Rapid intensification (RI) forecasting at lead times of +6 h to +48 h
2. High-resolution inner-core wind field and pressure reconstruction
3. Microwave image interpolation from sparse multi-source satellite passes
4. Track forecasting (downstream, via fine-tuning)

This is a standalone research project. It is not a version or extension of any prior system — it is designed from first principles with efficiency, modularity, and multi-architecture support in mind.

## Core data abstraction

The fundamental unit of this framework is a **source**: a collection of measurements of the same physical quantity, acquired by the same instrument or model, at the same nominal time, sharing a common coordinate system.

Every source, regardless of its dimensionality, is represented as a set of **(value, coordinate)** pairs:

| Source type | Example sources | Value shape | Coordinate channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0D** (scalar) | Best-track, buoy point obs | `(C,)` | time, lat, lon |
| **1D** (vertical profile) | Dropsonde, Argo float | `(L, C)` — L levels, C channels | time, lat, lon, altitude/depth |
| **2D** (image / field) | PMW satellite, IR geostationary, ERA5 field | `(H, W, C)` | time (scalar), lat grid `(H, W)`, lon grid `(H, W)` |

**Hard constraints — never violate these:**
- Coordinates are always **continuous and physical** (degrees, seconds since epoch, meters). No learned bin embeddings for coordinates.
- Coordinates are stored **alongside** values, not inferred from array indices.
- A source may have **missing values** (NaN-masked); the framework must handle this gracefully.
- The number of sources per sample is **variable**. No fixed-size source list.

## Dataset stack

### Active datasets

| Dataset | Content | Format | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TC-PRIMED v01r01** | PMW (11 sensors, 37 & 89 GHz), IR geostationary, ERA5 surface fields, DPR radar, best-track. 1987–2024, 3,552 storms, 242k+ overpasses | NetCDF, AI-ready | `TODO: $SCRATCH/tc_primed/` |
| **CyclObs** | L-band (SMOS, SMAP) + C-band SAR (Sentinel-1) surface wind speeds | NetCDF | `TODO: $SCRATCH/cyclobs/` |
| **NOAA AOML Dropsondes** | Vertical profiles (P, T, RH, u, v) from hurricane reconnaissance. ~13k sondes, North Atlantic + East Pacific | WMO TEMP DROP ASCII or NetCDF | `TODO: $SCRATCH/dropsondes/` |
| **Argo floats** | T/S profiles 0–2000 m depth, ~100k profiles/year globally. Key for upper ocean heat content | NetCDF (per-profile or gridded) | `TODO: $SCRATCH/argo/` |

### Deferred datasets

| Dataset | Reason |
|---|---|
| GFS / ECMWF HRES NWP fields | High value but requires careful train/test temporal split; integrate after baseline is stable |
| GPM DPR full 3D swaths | Partially in TC-PRIMED; full 3D integration deferred |
| TC-OBS, Saildrones | Limited coverage, derived labels — defer |

## On-disk preprocessed format

Preprocessing is a **two-stage pipeline**. Use `/preprocess` for the full workflow and dataset inventory.

### Stage 1 — Per-source format (`cfg.paths.preprocessed_sources`)

```
<preprocessed_sources>/
├── pmw_amsr2_gcomw1/
│   ├── metadata.yaml            ← source kind, channels, char_vars
│   ├── index.parquet            ← one row per snapshot; fast lookup without opening HDF5 files
│   └── snapshots/
│       └── {storm_id}_{YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ}.h5
├── pmw_ssmis_f18/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each HDF5 holds **exactly one source**; use `Source.path(sources_root, source_name, storm_id, snapshot_time_utc)` for canonical paths.

```
/
├── attrs: {storm_id, basin, snapshot_time_utc, lat, lon, vmax_kt, …}   ← Source.meta
├── scalar/{source_name}/  values float32 (C,)      coords float64 (3,)     attrs: {source_name, channels (JSON), char_vars (JSON)}
├── profile/{source_name}/ values float32 (L, C)    coords float64 (L, 4)   attrs: {source_name, channels (JSON), char_vars (JSON)}
└── field/{source_name}/   values float32 (H, W, C) coords float32 (H, W, 3) attrs: {source_name, channels (JSON), char_vars (JSON)}
```

Each sub-group also has an optional `mask` bool dataset (same leading shape as `values`).

### Stage 2 — Assembled format (`cfg.paths.preprocessed_data`)

`scripts/preprocess/assemble.py` merges per-source files into one HDF5 per storm and injects IBTrACS best-track data.

```
<preprocessed_data>/
├── {ibtracs_sid}.h5    ← one file per storm (ATCF ID used when no IBTrACS match)
└── index.parquet       ← global index: storm_id, basin, season, atcf_id, source_name,
                           snapshot_time_utc, lat, lon, vmax_kt
```

Each HDF5 holds **all sources for one storm**; use `StormData.path(assembled_root, storm_id)` for canonical paths.

```
/
├── attrs: {storm_id (IBTrACS SID), basin, season, atcf_id}
└── {source_name}/
    └── {compact_time}/           ← e.g., "20160912T010942Z"
        ├── values / coords / [mask]
        └── attrs: {source_name, channels (JSON), char_vars (JSON), kind, snapshot_time_utc, …meta}
```

IBTrACS best-track observations are injected as `source_name = "ibtracs_best_track"` (SCALAR, 7 channels: vmax_kt, mslp_hpa, rmw_nm, r34_{ne,se,sw,nw}_nm).

**Key conventions:**
- `StormData.sources` dict key: `(source_name, snapshot_time_utc)` using isoformat strings.
- Per-source `index.parquet` carries no split column. Train/val/test assignment is done separately by `scripts/preprocess/build_splits.py`, which reads the assembled `index.parquet` (which has a `season` column) and writes `{preprocessed_data}/train.parquet`, `val.parquet`, `test.parquet`.

**I/O API** (`src/tcfuse/data/sources/`):
- `Source.write(path)` / `Source.from_disk(path)` / `Source.read_meta(path)` / `Source.path(...)`
- `StormData.write(assembled_root)` / `StormData.from_disk(assembled_root, storm_id)` / `StormData.path(...)`
- `SourceMetadata.from_disk(source_dir)` / `MultisourceMetadata.from_disk(sources_root)`

```

**Rules:**
- Nothing in `notebooks/` is ever imported by `src/`.
- Each source embedder must be unit-testable with a **synthetic tensor** — no real data required for tests.
- `conf/experiment/` overrides are the only place where full run configurations are assembled. Never hardcode experiment parameters in `src/`.
- Path resolution is handled by `conf/paths/`. Select the environment at launch: `paths=local` (default) for local debugging, `paths=jz` on Jean-Zay. All code must reference paths via `cfg.paths.*` — never hardcode filesystem paths.

---

## Tech stack and coding conventions

**Core stack:** Python 3.10+, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Hydra (config), Weights & Biases (logging).

**Coding rules — always follow these:**
- Type hints on all function signatures.
- Docstrings on all public classes and functions (one-line summary + args/returns for non-trivial ones).
- No magic numbers anywhere in `src/`. Use named constants or config values.
- Tensor shapes must be documented in docstrings as comments: `# (B, L, C)`.
- All configurable hyperparameters live in `conf/`. Code reads from config; config does not live in code.
- Use inline comments liberally: add a short `# comment` above every logical code block (even small ones) to explain what it does.

**W&B conventions:**
- Project name: `TODO`
- Entity: `TODO`
- Run naming: `{architecture}_{sources}_{task}_{date}` — e.g. `perceiver_pmw-era5-argo_ri_20250901`
- Always log: source types present, number of training samples, GPU memory peak, val metrics per task head.

## Architecture philosophy

The framework is **architecture-agnostic at the backbone level**. The embedding layer (value + coordinate → token) and the task heads (decoder) are fixed interfaces; the encoder between them is swappable. This makes it straightforward to benchmark multiple architectures without rewriting data loading or training logic.

```
[Source 1: values + coords] ──┐
[Source 2: values + coords] ──┼──► [Source Embeddings] ──► [Encoder (swappable)] ──► [Task Head]
[Source N: values + coords] ──┘
```

**The encoder interface:**
- Input: a list of token sequences, one per source, each of shape `(B, N_i, D)` where `N_i` is the number of tokens for source `i` and `D` is the embedding dimension.
- Output: a representation that the task head can query — exact form depends on architecture (latent array for Perceiver, CLS token for ViT-style, etc.).
- The encoder must be instantiable from a Hydra config node.

**Candidate architectures to benchmark** (add to this list as needed):
- Perceiver / Perceiver IO
- Cross-attention Transformer (queries from anchor points or task positions)
- Hierarchical windowed attention (Swin-style, per source + cross-source)

**Self-supervised training task:** randomly mask one source at training time; reconstruct its values from all remaining sources, using only its coordinates and instrument metadata as queries. This is the default pre-training objective. Supervised fine-tuning follows for specific tasks.

## Jean-Zay cluster

Use the `/jz` skill for all cluster operations (storage layout, environment setup, W&B sync, SLURM parameters, checkpoint/resume, preflight checks).

SLURM parameters live in `conf/setup/jz_<hw>.yaml`; job submission uses `submitit.AutoExecutor` in `scripts/train.py` and `scripts/preprocess/<source>.py`. There is no manual bash SLURM template.

**Available GPU configs:**

| Config | Partition | Hardware | CPUs | Max walltime |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `jz_gpu_v100` | `gpu_p13` | 4× V100 32 GB | 40 (Intel) | 100 h (qos_gpu-t4) |
| `jz_gpu_a100` | `gpu_p5` | 8× A100 80 GB | 64 (AMD Milan) | **20 h** (no t4 QoS) |
| `jz_gpu_h100` | `gpu_p6` | 4× H100 80 GB | 96 (Intel) | 100 h (qos_gpu_h100-t4) |
| `jz_cpu` | `prepost` | Pre/post CPU nodes | 40 (Intel) | 20 h |

**Important:** A100 and H100 configs load `arch/a100` / `arch/h100` **before** `pytorch-gpu` — this is already encoded in their `setup_commands`. Do not reorder these.

Environment uses the prebuilt `pytorch-gpu/py3/2.8.0` module (no conda/pixi on compute nodes). Extra packages are installed once via `bash scripts/setup_jz.sh` on the login node. Compute nodes have no internet — all installs and data downloads must happen on the login or `prepost` node first.

### Archival to STORE

SCRATCH is auto-deleted after 30 days. All scripts that produce valuable data automatically submit an async archival job to the `archive` partition after successful completion. The archive job creates a `.tar.gz` on STORE (inode-safe). Archiving is a copy — the SCRATCH copy is left to auto-expire.

- **Trigger:** `archive: true` in the active setup config (all `jz_*` configs). Set `archive: false` (in `local.yaml`) to skip.
- **Granularity:** one tarball per preprocessed source type, one for assembled data, one per training run ID.
- **Archive paths:** `cfg.paths.archives.*` — defined in `conf/paths/jz.yaml` under `${paths.store}/archives/`.
- **Implementation:** `src/tcfuse/utils/archive.py` — `submit_archive_job(src, tar, cfg, job_name)`. Always uses partition `archive`, account `xyw@cpu`, 1 CPU, 4 h timeout.
- **Reference config:** `conf/setup/jz_archive.yaml` (documentation only — not loaded by scripts).

## Workflow rules for Claude Code

1. **Read this file first** at the start of every session, before reading any other file or writing any code.
2. **Plan before implementing.** For any non-trivial task, propose a plan (module structure, interface, test strategy) and wait for approval before writing code.
3. **One module at a time.** Implement and test one component fully before moving to the next.
4. **Update this file** when any of the following happens:
   - A new source type or embedding convention is decided → update the data abstraction table
   - A new architecture is added → update the architecture section
   - A new SLURM script is written → add it to the scripts table
   - A new dataset path is confirmed → update the dataset table
   - A new W&B convention is established → update the logging section
5. **Ask, don't guess** on design decisions not covered by this file. Especially: tensor layout, coordinate normalization strategy, masking implementation, task head interface.
6. **Prefer explicit over implicit.** If a function's behavior depends on the presence or absence of a source, make that conditional explicit in the code and documented in the docstring.
7. **Tests are not optional.** Every new embedding module ships with a unit test using a synthetic `(B, N, C)` tensor. Every data loader change ships with a test that runs on a 10-sample subset.
